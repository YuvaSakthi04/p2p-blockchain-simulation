## P2P Blockchain Simulation

This project simulates a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) blockchain network using Python, Flask, and HTTP communication. 
Each node maintains its own blockchain, mines blocks with Proof of Work (PoW), registers peers, and resolves conflicts to stay in sync with the longest chain rule.


## Features

- Add new transactions via a web form
- Mine blocks with basic Proof of Work(PoW)
- View blockchain in JSON
- Register peer nodes
- Sync chains using the "longest chain wins" consensus
- Web dashboard for user interaction (HTML + CSS)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Flask (web framework)
- requests (for peer-to-peer HTTP communication)
- HTML/CSS (Flask templates for dashboard)

## Working

This project simulates a fully decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network, where each node (Flask server) independently maintains a copy of the blockchain, mines blocks, and communicates with other peers over HTTP. Here's a breakdown of how the system works:

**1. Node Structure**
Each instance of node.py represents a node in the network:

Runs on a unique port (e.g., 5000, 5001, 5002)

Maintains its own copy of the blockchain

Has the ability to mine, transact, and sync with peers

**2. Transactions**
Users can submit new transactions via the web interface. These transactions:

Contain sender, recipient, and amount

Are temporarily stored in a transaction pool (current_transactions)

Wait to be mined into a block

**3. Mining & Proof of Work (PoW)**
Mining performs two key tasks:

Solves a PoW problem â€” it finds a number (nonce) such that the hash of the previous proof and current guess starts with four leading zeroes (0000)

Once solved, it:

Creates a new block

Adds all pending transactions into the block

Rewards the miner with 1 unit of coin

Appends the block to the local chain

This PoW system ensures computational effort and resists spamming/fraud.

**4. Registering Peer Nodes**
Nodes can register other peer nodes using their IP:port. Once registered:

The node keeps track of peer addresses

Enables network-wide communication and chain sharing

**5. Conflict Resolution & Consensus**
In a real blockchain, different nodes might have slightly different chains due to timing delays. To maintain consistency:

The system uses a simple consensus algorithm:
Longest valid chain wins

When /nodes/resolve is triggered:

The node fetches all peer chains

Validates them for hash integrity and PoW correctness

If a longer valid chain is found, it replaces its own

This mechanism ensures that the network converges to a single version of the truth.

**6. Viewing the Blockchain**
Users can:

View the full blockchain in a readable JSON format via /chain

See each block's index, timestamp, transactions, PoW, and hash links

**7. Web Dashboard**
A clean, responsive dashboard is provided where users can:

Add transactions through a form

Mine new blocks with one click

Register peer nodes

Resolve conflicts

View pending transactions and all blocks visually
